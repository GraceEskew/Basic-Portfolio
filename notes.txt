form issue - spacing btwn label and input field in contact.css


//attempted changes to the labels
1. tried adding bottom padding - not budging
2. tried altering bottom margin - not budging
3. tried adding <br> too much space
4. tried adding a div box in between label and input as a means of forcing. With a height of 0.5 and a width of 1 -- too much space. 

--google
5. tried non line breaking space - added space right before input selector - cool, but no. 
 

//to the inputs
1. added padding-top -- extends the input box, but not the space btwn the name and box outline. 

tried changes to: input#name in css
1. added padding-top: 10px; still extends the message box.
