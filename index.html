                    <p> 
                        Grace "Gracie" Eskew was born in Houston, TX in September of 1986, Due to the age differnece between her and her siblings, 
                        Gracie grew to love hobbies that she could do on her own. From an early age, she fostered a love for art, drama, reading, exploring 
                        anything with more than 3 trees, and expressed an early interest in not only playing video games, but their production.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2000, Gracie moved with her mother to the Dallas subburb of Plano, TX. There she attended Williams High School and later 
                        Plano East Senior High School, active in the Chey-Anne and Golden Girl Dance and Drill Teams respectively until her senior year. 
                        Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond anyone's control, Gracie found herself homeless at 17. Taking action, she found a place to stay 
                        6 hours west in Midland, TX, but would have to wait until her 18th birthday to enroll herself in school. In her senior year alone, Gracie 
                        attended 4 different high schools, and would end up finising her course work 2 months early... after starting nearly 3 months behind. 
                        From there she attended (then) Midland Community College, double majoring in History and Art, since the school didn't have an Anthropology program. 
                        While in college, she became an active member in Anime Club, representing the club at club rush and in a memorable ad capaign for homecoming court. 
                        As a student, she sold her first original work for $120, a loaf of homemade bread, and a jar of homemade cactus pear jam, which she still 
                        regrets not getting the recipie for.

                    <p>
                        She currently resides back in Dallas, TX with her husband and 2 cats; Saki and Hina. She is a member of the Women Who Code DFW chapter, and spends 
                        her free time studying, rucking, cooking, playing video games, and maintaining a "slice-of-life" Instagram account.

                    <p>
                        Random Fact: Her favorite book is Great Expectations because of "how all the characters connect to one another", and is a fan of the
                        swedish power metal band Sabaton.
